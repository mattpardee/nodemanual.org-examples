// Example

 // String.fromCharCode() alone can't get the character at such a high code point
 // The following, on the other hand, can return a 4-byte character as well as the
 // usual 2-byte ones (i.e., it can return a single character which actually has
 // a string length of 2 instead of 1!)

console.log(fixedFromCharCode(0x2F804)); // or 194564 in decimal

function fixedFromCharCode (codePt) {
  if (codePt > 0xFFFF) {
    codePt -= 0x10000;
    return String.fromCharCode(0xD800 + (codePt >> 10), 0xDC00 + (codePt & 0x3FF));
  }
  else {
    return String.fromCharCode(codePt);
  }
